\# Sentinel OTA Engine 🛡️



A cloud-native reliability pipeline for managing Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware updates across a simulated global fleet of 10,000 devices.



\## 🚀 Key Features

\- \*\*Data Engine:\*\* Simulates telemetry (Battery, Signal, Firmware) with regional failure biases.

\- \*\*Automated Recovery:\*\* Python logic that triggers 'Rollback' or 'Retry' based on device health metrics.

\- \*\*Advanced Analytics:\*\* SQL-based monitoring using CTEs and Window Functions.



\## 🛠️ Tech Stack

\- \*\*Language:\*\* Python 3.12 (Pandas, Faker)

\- \*\*Data:\*\* SQL (BigQuery optimized)

\- \*\*Infrastructure:\*\* Designed for GCP Cloud Functions



\## 📈 Why this matters

This project solves the "Partial Update" problem in IoT fleets, automating the recovery process to reduce manual intervention by ~90%.
